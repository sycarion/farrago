# Farrago

## Introduction

Farrago is a role-playing game that takes what I enjoy from all the role-paying games I've played and incorporates those elements into the role-playing game that my kids enjoy.

There are three books that make up the core rules: Possibilties for Players, Advice for Ajudciators, and Encounters for Explorers. 

The Possibilities Book provides options for character, including equipment mundance and magical.

Ajudicator is my word for a Game Master or a Referee. Hopefully, it can be a source of inspiration for the next session or just fun to read.

Encounters are more than stat blocks and epic battles, but those aren't left out. Encounters will also include potential allies, foils, and factions.
