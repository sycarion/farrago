## Introduction

Farrago is a role-playing game that takes what I enjoy from role-paying games old and new. It incorporates those elements into a game that feels older, but can play as lightly or crunchy as you would like.

The Foundational Folio contains the essential rules for play. It covers rolling dice to determine success, straightforward character choices for fantasy worlds, and pre-generated characters to being play quickly.

For more in-depth rules and advice, there are three books that comprise the core rules: Possibilties for Players, Advice for Ajudciators, and Encounters for Explorers. 

The Possibilities Book provides options for character, including equipment mundance and magical.

Ajudicator is my word for a Game Master or a Referee. Hopefully, it can be a source of inspiration for the next session or just fun to read.

Encounters are more than stat blocks and epic battles, but those aren't left out. Encounters will also include potential allies, foils, and factions.
