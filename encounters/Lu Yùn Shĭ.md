## The Traveller

Lu Yùn Shĭ travels the planes to explore and document the various worlds. In his universe, many kith and kin are imbued with a terrible and unknown power. These metahumans are known to possess extreme strength, wield strange magic, or build devices beyond imagination. As proof, he carries a pistol unknown in our world. No smith has been able to examine it closely, but it is devoid of magic as we know it. Despite its apparent lack of magic, it is more powerful than any spitter or blunderbuss known in our world.

He speaks often about the rise of the Axum nation, a substance called Ball Iron, and fantastical ships that travel to other planets. Although we know of the flying ships built in Temple of Oa, those ships cannot reach more than a few hundred feet above the ground.

He insists he is of human kith, but many believe him to be an avatar of a nameless Alapheem.
