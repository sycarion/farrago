# Farrago

------

## Foreword

The game I first played is Moldvay's Basic and Expert rules for D&D. Since that introduction, I've played several other games outside of versions of the world's oldest rpg. The early 2000s saw the creation of games with the same feeling as these old games, but usually with more straightforward rules.

The offspring of these early games took the bones of the old games to play with simpler and more streamlined rules. Farrago represents something between the minimalist and the Rube Goldberg engines I adored as a child.

I hope that you enjoy reading and playing this game. If nothing else, I hope you find something that you can use in your own game.

## Players

Everyone that joins a session of Farrago is a player, including a special player called the Ajudicator or Game Master. For the purposes of this book, however, players will refer to all the participants except for the Ajudicator.
