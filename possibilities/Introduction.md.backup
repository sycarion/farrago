# Farrago

## Foreword

The game I first played is Moldvay's Basic and Expert rules for D&D. Since that introduction, I've played several other games and newer versions of the world's oldest rpg. As much as I love the rules I started with, I've found that what players enjoy has changed since the early 80s. For example, it's been my experience that new players I meet are interested in building a specific type of character with many choices for Ancestry, Background, Culture, Magic, and Special Abilities. They enjoy playing *that specific* character and seeing how they interact with the game world. I have begun to enjoy that as well as innovations created over time by game designers. An example of that would be narrative distance. In other words, describing distance in terms of close, near, far, and distant. As much as I ran games in the 80s without miniatures and battle mats, the rules stated everything in exact distances. This would invariably create issues when players and I disagreed on what 30 feet meant or whether the archer was really in close range or not. There are new styles of gameplay that feel similar to the games of my youth, but cut down on bookkeeping and esoteric boosts/banes.

I hope that you find something that you can use in your own game.
