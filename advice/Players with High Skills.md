## Players with High Skills

Once characters have skill levels 4 and above and base stats in the 30s, it might be tough to provide a challenge. One option is to go above 10, but I prefer to roll 3d30. Instead of a number to multiply by 10, you are directly rolling the lower target number.

On average, you'll roll a 45 or 46, but there is still a good chance of rolling in the 70s.
