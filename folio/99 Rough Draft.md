## Introduction
ff

### Dice
This game uses regular six-sided dice and two ten-sided dice.

### Core Mechanic
For rolls that determine success or failure, the player will roll d% equal or lower than a target number. The target number is determined by the stat multiplied by a character's skill level plus adjustments based on circumstances, equipment, or luck.

## Characters
The characters are what players use to interact with the world.

#### Depletion Dice
Equipment breaks down through use. To represent this process, all equipment are rated with one to four depletion dice. Depletion dice are always six-sided dice.

After a piece of equipment has been used, the depletion dice are rolled. Any roll of 4 or less lowers the equipment rating by one die. If the rating goes down to 0, the item is destroyed and unrepairable. Equipment can be repaired or upgraded to increase its rating up to, but not exceeding four.

For example, after a battle, the warrior rolls depletion dice for their sword and armor. The roll for the sword is 4, so its rating changes from 3 to 2. The roll for the armor is above 4, so its rating is unchanged.

If the player has a maintenance kit or takes the sword to a smith, the rating can be raised back to a 3. It the player takes the same sword to a master craftsman, the rating could increase to 4, but that would take a lot of time and money.

Depletion Dice most often affect ammunition and magic items. A quiver of arrows can empty quickly depending on how many were purchased. A higher rating for arrows means that more were purchased. Unlike melee weapons, arrows and most ammunition can be recovered to raise the rating.

**Optional Rule:** When Ammunition is reduced to a rating of one, the player may choose to roll that one die to determine the exact amount of ammunition left. For example, if the Rogue's arrows are reduced to a rating of 1 and no arrows can be recovered, they may choose to roll a die to determine the exact number of arrows left.
