## Magic
The basic premise of magic is that with enough time, a person can generate any magical effect that they want. The issues that prevent apocalyptic power from being wielded include the lifespan, skill, and vitality of the wizard.

The greater the skill of the wizard, the less time or vitality required to cast the spell. The same true for the other two factors, the greater the time available, the less skill or vitality required, etc.

As a result, four philosophies of magic exist based on their approach to magic:

Wizards increase their skill through relentless study, practice, and calculation. They create and write various tomes, capture spells in scrolls and other objects.

Sorcerers manipulate time to various ways to increase the time spent manifesting a spell despite appearing instanteous to an outside observer. Time manipulation also helps them to make impossible objects in a short about of time.

Muscle Masters work their physical bodies to increase vitality to empower their spells. Often mistaken for rage, through sheer force of strength, they wrestle a spell into submission, releasing the desired effect.

Staterans create spells through the development of all three aspects, not favoring one over the other. Prizing harmony and balance, spells are encouraged into existence by more gentle means without the harsh manipulation of the mind, body, or lifespan.
