## Characters
Every player has a character to interact with the world described by the ajudicator. 

### Creating a Character
The process of creating a character uses familiar options derived from fantasy role playing games. Other options are available based on what all the players, including the ajudicator, have agreed uopon.

### Kith & Kin
Kith & Kin represent a character's ancestry (kith) and where they grew up (kin). Their kith informs their outward appearance to any level the player wishes. A chracter's kith also provides a minor boon.

Kin represents the relationships and environment where the character grew up. Their experiences have the greatest impact on how they view the world and their basic capabilities. A character's kin may provide a modifier to one of more base stats, but will always provide at least one starting skill.

#### Dwarves

#### Elves

#### Humans

#### Halflings

### Base Stats
There are six base stats for characters, Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. To determine your base stats, roll 3d6 for each stat. Your ajudicator may provide other options.

#### Constitution

#### Intelligence

### Skills
Skills represent training to perform a non-magical task. Gaining a level in a skill requires 10 XP * the next highest level. For example, to go from Level 3 to 4 in a skill, the cost is 40 XP.

#### ATHLETICS (STR)

#### CRAFT(INT)
 This skill measures the characterâ€™s ability to make and repair a specific type of items. This would include smithing, thatching, bowyer, brickmason, or carpentry.
 
As a very rough guide, it takes one day per 50 SP to produce an item. The base cost of the article in materials needed is 50% of the listed finished value.

#### LANGUAGES (INT)

#### SLIGHT OF HAND (DEX)
This skill includes any ledgerdemain, picking pockets, or Find the Lady. 

#### WEAPON (STR/DEX)

### Professions

#### Rogue

#### Warrior

#### Wizard

### Equipment

#### Depletion Dice
Equipment breaks down through use. To represent this process, all equipment are rated with one to four depletion dice. Depletion dice are always six-sided dice.

After a piece of equipment has been used, the depletion dice are rolled. Any roll of 4 or less lowers the equipment rating by one die. If the rating goes down to 0, the item is destroyed and unrepairable. Equipment can be repaired or upgraded to increase its rating up to, but not exceeding four.

For example, after a battle, the warrior rolls depletion dice for their sword and armor. The roll for the sword is 4, so its rating changes from 3 to 2. The roll for the armor is above 4, so its rating is unchanged.

If the player has a maintenance kit or takes the sword to a smith, the rating can be raised back to a 3. It the player takes the same sword to a master craftsman, the rating could increase to 4, but that would take a lot of time and money.

Depletion Dice most often affect ammunition and magic items. A quiver of arrows can empty quickly depending on how many were purchased. A higher rating for arrows means that more were purchased. Unlike melee weapons, arrows and most ammunition can be recovered to raise the rating.

**Optional Rule:** When Ammunition is reduced to a rating of one, the player may choose to roll that one die to determine the exact amount of ammunition left. For example, if the Rogue's arrows are reduced to a rating of 1 and no arrows can be recovered, they may choose to roll a die to determine the exact number of arrows left.
