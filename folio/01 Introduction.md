## Introduction
This book contains only the basic rules to play Farrago. The intended audience are those familiar with role playing games in general. It is also intended for players and ajudicators familiar with Farrago.

### Dice
This game uses regular six-sided dice and two ten-sided dice. Other dice are ocassionally used.

### Core Mechanic
In situations with a chance for success or failure, the player will roll d% between a lower target number and an upper target number. The upper target number is determined by the appropriate stat multiplied by a character's skill level plus modifiers based on circumstances, equipment, and/or luck. The lower target number is determined by a difficulty level set by the ajudicator multiplied by 10.

For example, Zoran is a character with an Agility of 16, a lockpicking skill level of 4, and a magical charm that adds 10%. When Zoran attempts to pick the lock, the upper target number is 16 (AGI) * 4 plus 10. This provides an upper target number of 94.

The ajudicator determines that the lock has a difficulty level of 5. This makes the lower target number 50. Zoran must roll between 50 and 94 inclusive to pick the lock.

In game play, Zoran's character sheet will already show the lockpicking skill as 84. When attempting the pick the lock, the player will simply need to add 10 to determine the upper target number. The ajudicator may simply state the lower target number instead of stating the difficulty level of the lock.

The players may also use any means to lower the difficulty level of the lock through others means such as magic, knowledge of locks, or brute force. Although extremely unlikely, it is technically possible for a character to talk a lock into simply opening up.
