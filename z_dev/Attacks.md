## Resources you can take from 5e characters

There seems to be a heirarchy of effects. Here is my best effort to categorize them. The goal is to simplify them and apply them to weapon properties. There seems to be seven things affected: Ability Checks, Speed, Saving Throws, Attack Rolls, Actions, Reactions, and human senses (sight, hearing, etc.). There is also a special effect to halve maximum hit points. 

* Disadvantage on specific ability checks to a specific target
* Disadvantage on specific ability checks to a specific type of creature/thing
* Disadvantage on all ability checks
* Automatic failure of specific ability check
* Speed halved
* Cannot move willingly toward target
* Hit point maximum halved
* Speed is zero
* Disadvantage on specific saving throws from a specific target
* Disadvantage on specific saving throws from a specific type of creature/thing
* Disadvantage on one saving throw
* Disadvantage on two saving throws
* Disadvantage on all saving throws
* Disadvantage on attack rolls
* Cannot attack specific target
* Cannot take actions
* Cannot make reactions
* Cannot take actions or reactions
* Cannot use one human sense.
* Cannot use more than one human sense.
* Add a level of exhaustion

Other things not covered in conditions are the Immunity, Resistance, Vulnerablity, Defenseless spectrum

In combat, you can drain hit points with a type of damage.

Can a creature take spell slots?

Can a creature lower the proficiency bonus (and thereby restrict special abilities that can be performed a number of times a day equal to their proficiency bonus per long rest?)

Can a creature target a specific action?

Can a creature target a specific trigger that causes a reaction?

* prevent triggering the Ready action?
* Prevent dismounting and landing on your feet if your mount is knocked prone
* prevent identifying a spell with Intelligence(Arcana) check with DC 15+Spell level?
* prevent Opportunity Attack from movement, reach, or feat?
