# My rules
This is how I want to play an rpg

### Possibilities for Players
ancestry, backgrounds, cultures, class options, skills, feats, etc.

### Advice for Ajudicators
Inspirational Tables, handling narrative play, making stuff that isn't in the rules

### Encounters for Exploration
More than things to fight, this is factions, landmarks, places, and other things alive, inanimate, or otherwise.
